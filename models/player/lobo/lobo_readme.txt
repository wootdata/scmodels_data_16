Accessory's Name	: Lobo
Installation directory  : Half-Life/valve/models/player/
Author                  : Daniel Beswick

Accessory's description	: This is based on one of the only mainstream comic book
			  characters I would ever be caught reading in public;
			  Lobo, Assassin to Royalty, Scourge of the Cosmos,
			  Master of Frag, Mr Machete, and Bounty Hunter
			  Supreme. Somebody has probably done him before, but
			  this is also my first ever scratch built model, so
			  I thought I'd stick with something I know.
			  This is also the reason why the animations are the 
			  default heavy grunt stock. Maybe I'll update them
			  when I'm more capable.


Additional Credits to   : valve, chumbalum soft, and DC

You know who Half-Life belongs to, the Lobo character belongs to DC, and this model is mine, all mine. But not the animations.

Feel free to tinker with him, but abuse me, and I'll send a frustrated convict over to teach you why abuse hurts from the inside. M'kay?
